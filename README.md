## About

üá®üá± A bot ü§ñ that pays your taxes, automatically.

‚ö†Ô∏è If you only want a CLI command to pay your taxes, you can use [donna](https://github.com/muzk/donna) directly. `donna-scheduler` was done specifically to automate the CLI script without worrying about it.

## How it works

This bot will use your SII credentials and will try to pay your taxes.

Under the hood, this bot uses [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) (via [donna](https://github.com/muzk/donna)) to automate this boring web task.

## Features

- **Easy to use**: just run `pay.js` script with the required environment variables.
- **Idempotent**: run `pay.js` the times you want, it won't do the web task again if it already worked.
- **1 click deploy**: click "Deploy to Heroku" button or [here](https://heroku.com/deploy) and you're (almost) done.

## Deployment

I recommend you to deploy it to heroku because it's easy and free (free tier). Just click Deploy button and configure the scheduler.

**Step 1:**

**Step 2:**

Now add a job to your scheduler:

- _Schedule_: every day at anytime you want
- _Run command_: node pay

Done üéâ click "Save Job"

## Environment variables

Here is a description of the environment variables:

- `RUT` and `PASSWORD`: your [SII](https://misiir.sii.cl/cgi_misii/siihome.cgi) credentials (**Required**).
- `MONGODB_URI`: a MongoDB URI (**Required**).
- `BOT_TOKEN` and `BOT_CHANNEL`: Telegram bot token and channel so you can receive a notification about a successfull payment. You can setup your own with [@botfather](https://telegram.me/botfather) (**Optional**).

## Requirements
